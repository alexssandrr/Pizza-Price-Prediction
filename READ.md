## Context
### The dataset given is for predicting the prices of pizza, the dataset is not complete at all, but you can use this dataset for learning or study or maybe you want to upgrade the data by yourself, is okay for me, hopefully, this dataset is useful for you guys, and use this dataset wisely.
### Time Line of the Project:
- Importing Libraries and DataSet
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model building using ML models
- Model building and prediction using Auto ML

## XGB Regressor
### We will use Grid Search CV for finding the best parameters
### We will be using the following models:
- XGB Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
### Auto ML
### EvalML is an open-source AutoML library written in python that automates a large part of the machine learning process and we can easily evaluate which machine learning pipeline works better for the given set of data.
